# Flowers-Image-Processing-
This project performs comprehensive image processing and analysis on a flower dataset using Python. It loads RGB images, extracts detailed statistical features (mean colors, contrast, skewness, etc.), performs data analysis with pandas, and visualizes results through various plots.

Key Components:
DataLoader: Loads and preprocesses images, converting them to standardized NumPy arrays.

FeatureExtractor: Extracts key image features like color channel means, overall brightness, contrast, and skewness.

DataAnalyzer: Performs statistical summaries and correlation analysis on extracted features, identifies dominant colors, and compares brightness.

DataVisualizer: Generates insightful visualizations including pie charts for dominant colors, boxplots for color distributions, correlation heatmaps, brightness comparisons, and color contribution trends across images.

The analysis reveals dominant colors in the dataset, channel intensity distributions, relationships between image features, and how color contributions vary across images.
